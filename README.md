This is my journey to make my own email server. 

This idea has been a long time coming. For a long time I have toyed with the idea of hosting my own email server and client. Yes there are a ton of services out there
but there is something about running everything on your own gear. 

I have struggled with this project for a while and it finally works! I thought that I would write this up 
to help other that need help with this idea. 

Go to my Wiki for the full write up. I hope this is helpful for someone!
